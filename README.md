# ShortShare
Backend for sharing of Siri Shortcuts

ShortShare comes with:
- Account Management
- Shortcut Creation

Coming to ShortShare soon:
- Shortcut Version Control
- QuickUpdateAPI

(+some more stuff)


Notes:
ShortShare is currently (very) unfinished and buggy. (You can't even have multiple accounts/shortcuts atm). I am currently not accepting pull requests or contributions until I flesh it out a bit more.
